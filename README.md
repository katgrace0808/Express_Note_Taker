# Express_Note_Taker

## Description
This is an application where users can enter a note, save it, recall it, and delete it.  The user adds a note title and some note text, 
and clicks the save button.  The note is saved to a json file, and the title is displayed in the left column.  When the user no longer
needs the note, they can click the delete button next to the note title, and the note is removed from the page in addition to the json
file.
